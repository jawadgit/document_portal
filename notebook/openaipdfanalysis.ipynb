      "<think> Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to the question \"AI is expanding in which area\n",
      "mostly.\" The context provided is a bit repetitive, but I'll parse through it to extract the\n",
      "necessary information.  First, the context mentions that AI agents are performing complex tasks\n",
      "autonomously. This suggests that AI is being used in areas where tasks require some level of\n",
      "independence and complexity. It's not just simple automation but handling intricate operations\n",
      "without human intervention.  Next, the context points out that OpenAI's AI advancements are growing\n",
      "exponentially. This indicates that the development and capabilities of AI technologies are rapidly\n",
      "increasing. OpenAI is a leader in the field, so their advancements would significantly impact the\n",
      "industry.  Then, the context states that in 2025, the AI market is expected to reach $62.7 billion.\n",
      "This figure is mentioned multiple times, emphasizing the projected growth and expansion of the AI\n",
      "market as a whole.  Looking at the question again, it's asking in which area AI is expanding the\n",
      "most. The context doesn't specify a particular sector like healthcare, finance, or education.\n",
      "Instead, it talks about AI's general growth and market size. It mentions AI agents performing\n",
      "complex tasks, which could relate to various areas, but without specific details, it's hard to\n",
      "pinpoint one.  However, since the context repeatedly mentions the growth of AI in general and the\n",
      "market size, it might be implying that AI is expanding mostly in terms of its overall market value\n",
      "and capabilities rather than a specific application area. So, the expansion is in the AI market as a\n",
      "whole, with advancements in handling complex tasks autonomously.  Wait, but the question is about\n",
      "the area, not the market. So maybe I should focus on the tasks aspect. The context says AI agents\n",
      "are performing complex tasks autonomously, which could mean the area is task automation or handling\n",
      "complex operations. But the question is about the area mostly expanding. Since the market size is\n",
      "mentioned, perhaps it's about the industry's growth.  Alternatively, considering the context's\n",
      "repetition about performing complex tasks, the area might be in the capabilities of AI to handle\n",
      "such tasks, implying that the expansion is in the functionality or applications of AI in complex\n",
      "areas.  I'm a bit confused because the context doesn't specify a particular sector but talks about\n",
      "market growth and task capabilities. Maybe the answer is that AI is expanding mostly in the area of\n",
      "handling complex tasks autonomously, which ties into various industries but isn't limited to one.\n",
      "Alternatively, since the market size is given, perhaps the expansion is in the economic or market\n",
      "area, but that doesn't quite fit the question about the area of expansion.  I think the best\n",
      "approach is to note that the context doesn't provide enough specific information to determine a\n",
      "particular area where AI is expanding the most. It mentions market growth and autonomous task\n",
      "handling, but without more details on specific sectors or applications, it's insufficient to\n",
